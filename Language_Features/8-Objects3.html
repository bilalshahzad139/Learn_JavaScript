             class like construct, we'll call such function as 'Employee' here.
             Constructor in JS is a special function which is called with 'new' keyword, it does three things
             1- Create an Object in memory
             2- Call constructor function with newly created object ('this' refers to this object inside function)
             3- returns 'this' automatically from constructor/function
